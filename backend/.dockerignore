# SQLite database file - if it's created inside the container or managed by a volume
# If you intend to copy a pre-populated database into the image via the 'data' dir,
# then do not ignore 'data/dashboard.db' or 'data/'.
# Given our Dockerfile creates 'data/', it's fine to not ignore the directory itself,
# but generally, instance-specific data files shouldn't be in the image.
# For development, including an empty 'data' dir in the context is okay.
